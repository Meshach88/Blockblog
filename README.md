the backbone of the cryptocurrencies can be applied in various fields and domains to achieve great results with a win-win situation. 
Decided project focuses on development of a platform for posting blogs but through a decentralized system rather than database management

all connected nodes, the most special feature of this platform is to provide a functionality for the viewers to send some tips to the 
bloggers using their Ethereum wallets.
